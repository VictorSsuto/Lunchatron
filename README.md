# AI-Powered Receipt Ingredient Detector

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered receipt scanner that detects ingredients from uploaded images and suggests meal ideas with recipe links. The system utilizes computer vision to recognize ingredients visually, without relying solely on text extraction.

This project was developed during **ConUHack IX**.

## Features
- Upload images of receipts or ingredients.
- AI detects ingredients visually and extracts text when necessary.
- Retrieve recipe suggestions based on detected ingredients.
- Integrated with Google Cloud Vision API for image processing.
